# Advent of Code

My attempts and solutions for Advent of Code 2020 & 2021. These are often refactored and cleaned up a bit, but I'll usually make a commit of my much messier code directly after I've solved the problem.

Setup:

    python3 -m venv .venv
    . .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
